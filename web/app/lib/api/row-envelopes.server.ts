/**
 * The member-lane ROW-OP envelopes — the `JsonEnvelope` bodies every naturally-idempotent row op
 * answers (follow/unfollow/exclude, channel join/leave, curation place/unplace, protect, notices ack,
 * invitation). They sit alongside the transport-fault family in `wire.server.ts` (which this reuses
 * for the uniform 404 + the 500), matching the vault's `wire::map` shapes field-for-field:
 *
 *  - an OK outcome → a 200 `ok_status_envelope` carrying a `status` string (or `ok_envelope` with a
 *    typed `data`, for the invitation);
 *  - a role/gate refusal → a 200 DENIED carrying a SPECIFIC code — never a 403, because the actor is
 *    an authenticated member (nothing to hide, so the refusal names WHY);
 *  - `member_required`/`unknown_skill`/`unknown_channel` → the uniform 404 (indistinguishable from a
 *    missing credential); any out-of-contract status → the 500.
 *
 * The vault serializes these through `serde`; this tier stringifies the identical field set (the unit
 * suite pins the literals). `receipt`/`error` are OMITTED (never serialized as null) on the OK
 * envelopes, exactly as the vault's `skip_serializing_if` drops them.
